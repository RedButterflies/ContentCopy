A Gift to Meng Haoran on Departing for Yangzhou

Old friend departing from the West,
Beneath the Yellow Crane Tower.
Sail on to Yangzhou!
In the morning mist and springtime flowers.

Your lonely boat is now a distant thing,
That sails where blue skies go.
And, I shall look upon the waves,
Unto the end they flow.
